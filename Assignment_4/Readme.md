## Abstract
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. Solve this system of equations for the numbers of nuclei.

##Background
According to the Problem 1.5, we know the corresponding rate equation are

where for simplicity we have assumed thet the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant, .

##Main body
From the question and equations, we can deduce expressions for NA and  NB that (the derivation process is much and hard to input, so I just skip it here):
